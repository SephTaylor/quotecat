## What QuoteCat Does

QuoteCat helps contractors create professional construction quotes from their phone in under 5 minutes. Contractors pick materials from a product catalog, add labor and markup, and send a shareable link to their client. Clients can accept or decline the quote directly from the link. The contractor gets notified in real-time when the client views, accepts, or declines.

## Zero Transaction Fees

Unlike competitors (Jobber, Housecall Pro, ServiceTitan) that charge 2.9% on every payment processed through their platform, QuoteCat charges zero transaction fees. Contractors set their preferred payment methods (Zelle, Venmo, CashApp, bank transfer, check, or any other method) and clients pay directly. The contractor keeps 100% of every payment.

For a contractor doing $300,000/year in jobs, this saves over $8,700/year compared to platforms that charge processing fees.
