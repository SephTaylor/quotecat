## Step-by-Step: Creating Your First Quote

1. **Start New Quote:** Tap the **+** button in the upper right on the Dashboard or Quotes screen.

2. **Enter Details:** Fill in the **project name** and **client name** (both required). Optionally add a description and quote reference number.

   - Tap the **+** button next to items to add them to your quote
   - Use the stepper controls to adjust quantities
   - Tap "Add Items" to continue, or "Done" when finished

4. **Add Labor Costs:**
   - Enter your labor cost in the "Labor" field
   - This is added separately from materials

5. **Materials (Quick Estimate):**
   - If you already know the total materials cost, enter it here
   - No need to add individual items from the database if using this method

6. **Set Markup:** Adjust the markup percentage to reflect your profit margin (default is typically 20-30%).

7. **Review & Export:**

**Tip:** You can edit quote details anytime before sending. Just tap the quote from the list to open the editor.

- **Editing Assemblies:**
  - Assemblies now show a collapsible "Current Products" section
