## 📲 How to Send Feedback

### Method 1: Email (Recommended)

**Send to:** [your-email@example.com]

**Good Feedback Examples:**

> "When I tried to add 100 studs to a quote, the +/- buttons were tedious. Can I type the quantity directly instead of tapping + 100 times?"

> "The swipe-to-delete gesture worked great, but I accidentally deleted a quote when scrolling. Maybe add a confirmation dialog?"

> "I created a plumbing quote and the prices seem way too low. 1/2" PVC pipe shows $2.50 but it's actually $4.50 at my local supplier."

**Include:**
- What you were doing (step-by-step)
- What happened vs. what you expected
- Your device model (iPhone 12, 15 Pro, etc.)
- Screenshots if helpful (use screenshot + email)

### Method 2: TestFlight Feedback

**From TestFlight app (not in QuoteCat):**
1. Open **TestFlight** app
2. Find **QuoteCat**
3. Scroll down to **"Send Beta Feedback"**
4. Write your feedback
5. Submit

**Note:** The shake-to-feedback gesture does NOT work in this version.

### What Makes Great Feedback?

**Be specific:**
- ✅ "The labor field only accepts whole dollars, but I charge $87.50/hr"
- ❌ "The app is confusing"

**Include context:**
- ✅ "When I duplicate a quote, the status should reset to Draft (it currently stays as 'Sent')"
- ❌ "Duplication is broken"

**Screenshots help:**

- Use iPhone screenshot (Power + Volume Up)
