**Stop losing jobs to slow quotes. Quote faster, win more bids.**

QuoteCat is the first mobile quoting app built specifically for contractors. Create professional, accurate quotes in 5 minutes while you're still on the job site.

Traditional quoting means:
- Going home after the job walk
- Booting up your laptop
- Spending hours in spreadsheets
- Sending quotes days later

By then, your client already hired someone faster.
