## Data Quality Issues Found

### Issue 1: Phantom Home Depot Store (Excel)

**There is no Home Depot store in Battle Creek, Michigan.**

The Excel file contains 10,597 items for a non-existent store:

```
Home Depot Excel - Location Breakdown:
----------------------------------------
  Battle_Creek: 10,597  ← Should not exist (no store)
  Kalamazoo: 10,522     ✓
  Lansing: 11,900       ✓
----------------------------------------
  TOTAL: 33,019
```

- The API correctly returns 0 items for Battle Creek HD
- The Excel incorrectly includes this phantom data
- Source of this data is unclear

### Issue 2: Duplicate Entries (Menards)

The Menards data contains **44 duplicate entries** (same SKU appearing twice for the same city):

```
Menards Excel:
----------------------------------------
  Total rows: 33,964
  Unique SKU + City combos: 33,920
  Duplicates: 44
----------------------------------------
```

Our sync correctly filters these out, but they shouldn't be in the source data.

### Issue 3: Duplicate Entries (Home Depot)

The Home Depot API returns duplicate SKUs within pages. Our sync dedupes these, but xByte should be filtering them at the source.

## Conclusions

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Lowe's API** | ✅ Working | 100% accurate |
| **Menards API** | ✅ Working | 100% accurate (we filter 44 source duplicates) |
| **Home Depot API** | ✅ Working | 100% accurate |
| **Excel Files** | ⚠️ Issues | Contains phantom store + duplicates |

**The API delivers accurate data. Our database is 100% correct.**

**Data quality issues exist at the source** (phantom stores, duplicate entries) but our sync handles them appropriately.

---

## Recommendations for xByte

1. **Remove phantom Battle Creek HD data** - There's no Home Depot in Battle Creek. The 10,597 items in the Excel shouldn't exist.

2. **Dedupe data at source** - Both Menards (44 dupes) and Home Depot have duplicate SKU entries for the same city. These should be filtered before delivery.

3. **Align Excel with API** - The API correctly excludes invalid data, but the Excel files include it. Both should match.
