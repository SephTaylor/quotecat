## Template 1: 3-Day Check-In (For Testers Who Installed)

**Subject:** How's QuoteCat working for you?

---

Hi [Tester Name],

Thanks for installing QuoteCat! I noticed you've been using the app for a few days, and I wanted to check in.

**Quick questions:**
1. Have you created any quotes yet?
2. Is anything confusing or not working as expected?
3. What do you like so far?
4. What's missing or could be better?

No need to write a formal report - just reply with your thoughts! Even a quick "this works" or "this is broken" helps immensely.

**Reminder:** You can also send feedback directly through TestFlight by shaking your device while in the app.

Thanks again for your help!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 2: 3-Day Check-In (For Testers Who Haven't Installed)

**Subject:** Did you get the TestFlight invite?

---

Hi [Tester Name],

Just checking in - I sent you a TestFlight invite for QuoteCat a few days ago but haven't seen you install yet.

**Possible issues:**
- Invite email went to spam? (Check junk folder)
- Don't have TestFlight app? (Download from App Store)
- Invite expired? (Let me know, I'll resend)
- Too busy right now? (No worries - just let me know!)

If you're still interested in testing, reply to this email and I'll make sure you get access.

No pressure if timing isn't good - I totally understand!

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## Pro Tips for Follow-Ups

### Timing
- First follow-up: 3 days after invite sent
- Second follow-up: 7 days after install
- Final follow-up: 14 days (if no response)

### Tone
- Keep it casual and friendly
- Don't guilt trip inactive testers
- Make it easy to respond (ask specific questions)
- Show appreciation constantly

### What Works
- Short emails get more responses
- Specific questions beat "any feedback?"
- Share other tester insights (anonymously)
- Show you're acting on feedback

### What Doesn't Work
- Long surveys (keep it conversational)
- Generic "how's it going?" (too vague)
- Pressure or urgency (they're doing you a favor)
- Radio silence (check in regularly)

**Remember:** Testers are volunteers. Be grateful, responsive, and respectful of their time!
