**Subject:** QuoteCat Android Beta - Help Me Test This Plumbing Quote App!

---

Hi [Plumber Name],

Thanks so much for agreeing to test QuoteCat on your Android phone! I really appreciate you taking the time to help me make this better for plumbers like you.

## What is QuoteCat?

QuoteCat is a mobile app that helps contractors create professional quotes fast—right on the job site. Think of it like having a smart assistant that does all the math for you while you're still talking to the customer.

**Goal:** Create quotes in 5-10 minutes instead of 30-60 minutes when you get home.

## What I Need You to Test

### Test 1: Create a Simple Plumbing Quote (5-10 minutes)

Try quoting a simple bathroom repair job:

1. **Open QuoteCat** and tap the "+" button
2. **Enter details:**
   - Project name: "Bathroom Sink Repair"
   - Client name: "Test Customer"
3. **Tap "Add materials"**
4. **Go to Plumbing category:**
   - Add some pipes, fittings, fixtures (whatever makes sense)
   - Use the +/- buttons to set quantities
5. **Tap "Add items"**
6. **Add labor:**
   - Enter your hourly rate × hours (e.g., $500)
7. **Apply markup (optional):**
   - Try 15% or whatever you normally use
8. **Tap "Review & Export"**
9. **Export as PDF:**
   - Tap "Export PDF"
   - Share it via email or save to your phone

**Questions:**
- Was it fast enough? (Goal: 5-10 minutes)
- Were the plumbing materials accurate/useful?
- Was anything confusing or hard to find?

---

### Test 2: Create a Bigger Job Quote (10-15 minutes)

Try a more complex job like a bathroom remodel:

1. Create a new quote (tap "+" again)
2. Add multiple categories of materials:
   - Plumbing (pipes, fixtures, etc.)
   - Maybe some framing or drywall if you do that too
3. Add labor for multiple days of work
4. Export as PDF and see how it looks

**Questions:**
- Did you have enough materials to choose from?
- What plumbing products are missing?
- Would you actually send this PDF to a customer?

---

### Test 3: Test Offline Mode

This is a key feature—QuoteCat works WITHOUT internet:

1. **Turn off WiFi and mobile data** on your phone
2. **Create a new quote** (should work perfectly offline)
3. **Add materials, labor, export PDF**
4. **Turn WiFi/data back on**

**Questions:**
- Did everything work offline?
- Is this useful for basements/crawlspaces with no signal?

---

## Key Features to Try

**Dashboard:**
- See all your quotes in one place
- Quick stats (how many quotes, total value)
- Pin important quotes to the top

**Materials Picker:**
- 100+ products across 8 categories
- Plumbing category has pipes, fittings, fixtures
- Use +/- buttons to set quantities

**Quote Status:**
- Draft → Sent → Approved → Completed
- Tap the status chips to change
- Helps you track your pipeline

**Duplicate Quotes:**
- Swipe left on any quote
- Tap "Duplicate"
- Perfect for similar jobs (e.g., multiple bathrooms)

**Search:**
- Search bar at top of Quotes tab
- Find quotes by customer name or project

---

## What to Look For

### Things I NEED to Know:

1. **Speed:** Is it actually faster than your current method (Excel, pen & paper)?
2. **Materials:** Are the plumbing products useful? What's missing?
3. **Pricing:** Are the prices in the ballpark? (They're estimates, not live pricing)
4. **Usability:** Is it easy to use on a phone with gloves/dirty hands?
5. **Would you use it?** Honestly—would you use this on real job sites?

### Things That Might Be Broken:

- App crashes or freezes
- Calculations are wrong
- PDFs don't generate or look weird
- Materials picker is slow or buggy
- Anything else that doesn't work right

## How to Give Feedback

**Option 1: Quick Text/Email**
Just reply to this email or text me with:
- What worked well
- What didn't work or was confusing
- What's missing that you'd need to actually use this

**Option 2: Detailed Feedback (if you have time)**
I created a feedback form in the app:
- Settings tab → "Email Support"
- Or just email me directly: [YOUR EMAIL]

**Option 3: Screenshot + Voice Note**
If you see something weird:
- Take a screenshot
- Send it to me with a quick voice note explaining what happened

## Pricing Info (FYI)

Right now you're testing the **Free tier** which has:
- 25 quotes total
- 5 PDF exports per month
- 2 CSV exports per month

I'm planning **Pro tier** ($15-30/month) with:
- Unlimited quotes and exports
- Custom templates (save common jobs)
- Cloud backup

**Question:** Would you pay $15-30/month for this if it saved you 20-30 minutes per quote?

---

## Timeline

**This week:** Just play around, break stuff, tell me what you think
**Next week:** I'll fix bugs based on your feedback
**Goal:** Launch to more contractors by [DATE]

No rush—test whenever you have time between jobs. Even 30 minutes of feedback is super valuable.
