# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

QuoteCat is a React Native Expo app for creating and managing construction quotes. It allows users to build quotes from a product catalog, manage materials, calculate labor costs, and generate PDFs. The app uses local AsyncStorage for persistence with plans to migrate to Supabase.

## Website Deployment (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT:** The quotecat.ai website is hosted on Netlify and deploys from the `integration/all-features` branch, NOT `main`.

- **Production branch:** `integration/all-features`
- **Website files:** `website/` directory
- **Hosting:** Netlify
- **Domain:** quotecat.ai (migrated from GoDaddy to Netlify)
- **Forms:** Netlify Forms enabled for beta signups

When making website changes:
1. Work in `integration/all-features` branch (or merge to it before pushing)
2. Push to `integration/all-features` to trigger Netlify deploy
3. Deploys typically take 10-15 seconds
4. Check Netlify dashboard for deploy status

## Commands

### Development

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npx expo start           # Start Metro bundler
npx expo start -c        # Start with cache cleared
npm run android          # Run on Android
npm run ios              # Run on iOS
npm run web              # Run on web
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint             # Run ESLint (expo lint)
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file at project root with:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

If these are missing, you'll see an error in development. Restart Metro after adding: `npx expo start -c`

## Architecture

### Module System

The codebase uses a modular architecture with domain-specific modules in `modules/`:

- **quotes**: Quote persistence and business logic using AsyncStorage. Handles legacy key migration from multiple storage keys.
- **catalog**: Product catalog with categories (framing, drywall, electrical, plumbing). Products have id, name, unit, and unitPrice.
- **assemblies**: Templates for groups of products with computed quantities (e.g., "frame a room" uses dynamic qty calculations based on room dimensions).
- **materials**: Product selection UI with Map-based selection state.
- **wizard**: Multi-step form navigation system with validation.
- **library**: In-memory storage for reusable entries (assemblies, templates). Designed to swap with Supabase later.
- **core/ui**: Shared UI components (FormScreen, BottomBar, MoneyInput, Stepper, Screen).
- **providers**: Context providers for app-wide state.
- **settings**: App settings and configuration.
- **review**: Quote review and PDF generation logic.

### File Structure Conventions

- `modules/[domain]/index.ts`: Main exports for the module
- `modules/[domain]/types.ts`: TypeScript types and interfaces
- `modules/[domain]/ui/`: React components specific to that domain
- `lib/`: Cross-cutting utilities (storage, supabase, quotes API)
- `app/`: Expo Router file-based routing
  - `app/(main)/`: Main tab navigation screens
  - `app/(forms)/`: Form and wizard screens
  - `app/_layout.tsx`: Root layout with SafeAreaProvider

### Routing

Uses Expo Router (v6) with file-based routing:

- `/` → Home screen (quote list)
- `/quote/[id]/edit` → Edit quote form
- `/quote/[id]/materials` → Material selection
- `/quote/[id]/review` → Review and generate PDF
- `/wizard/...` → Multi-step quote creation wizard

### Data Layer

**Quotes Storage (`modules/quotes/index.ts`)**:

- Uses AsyncStorage with legacy key migration
- Reads from multiple keys: `@quotecat/quotes`, `quotes`, `qc:quotes:v1`
- Always writes to primary key: `@quotecat/quotes`
- De-duplicates by id, preferring latest updatedAt/createdAt
- Normalizes data with forward-compatible extra fields

**Library Storage (`modules/library/`)**:

- Currently in-memory Map
- Designed to swap with Supabase without changing call sites
- Exports: `saveEntry`, `getAll`, `getByKind`, `removeEntry`

**Quote Types**:

- `StoredQuote`: Persisted quote with id, name, clientName, items[], labor, timestamps
- `QuoteItem`: Product reference with productId, name, unitPrice, qty, optional currency
- Both types support forward-compatible extra fields via `[key: string]: any`

**Normalization**:

- `normalizeQuote()` and `normalizeItem()` ensure data integrity
- Computes total on save (never trust stored totals)
- Handles missing/invalid timestamps gracefully

### Path Aliases

- `@/*` maps to project root
- Configured in both `tsconfig.json` and `babel.config.js`
- Use `@/modules/...`, `@/lib/...`, `@/constants/...` for imports

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- Expo base config extended
- Excludes: `node_modules`, `app/_old`, `modules/_old`

### Key Dependencies

- **Expo Router**: File-based navigation (v6)
- **React Native Reanimated**: Animations (keep plugin LAST in babel.config.js)
- **AsyncStorage**: Local persistence
- **Supabase**: Backend (configured but not fully integrated)
- **expo-print & expo-sharing**: PDF generation

## Important Patterns

### Async Storage Patterns

When working with quotes, always use the repo functions in `modules/quotes/index.ts`:

- `listQuotes()`: Returns all quotes sorted by most recent
- `getQuoteById(id)`: Fetch single quote
- `saveQuote(quote)`: Create or update (auto-merges and timestamps)
- `updateQuote(id, patch)`: Partial update
- `deleteQuote(id)`: Remove quote

### Form State Management

Multi-step forms use the wizard pattern:

- Define steps with id, title, optional validate function
- Validation returns error message or null/undefined
- See `modules/wizard/types.ts` for `WizardStep<TState>` interface

### Assembly Expansion

Assemblies can have fixed or computed quantities:

- `{ productId, qty }`: Fixed quantity
- `{ productId, qtyFn: (vars) => number }`: Computed from variables
- See `modules/assemblies/expand.ts` for pricing logic

### Navigation Defaults

Quote UI components accept optional `onPress`/`onLongPress` handlers. When omitted, they default to navigating to edit screen. See `modules/quotes/ui/index.ts:8`.

## Code Style

### ESLint

- Uses expo's flat config format
- Ignores `dist/*`
- Note: `import/no-named-as-default` is silenced for this project

### Prettier

- Active for formatting
- Ignores `_old/` directories
- Run format before commits

### Recent Fixes

- Import warnings silenced for default exports
- Quote UI handlers now accept optional callbacks
- Unescaped apostrophes fixed in JSX strings

## 🎯 Business Model & Monetization Strategy

### CRITICAL: Avoid Apple's 30% Commission

**DO NOT implement in-app purchases in Phase 1.** All payments must go through external website to avoid Apple taking 30%.

**Allowed in App:**
- ✅ Show locked features with "Pro" badge
- ✅ "Learn More" button → opens website in Safari
- ✅ Login screen for users who bought on website
- ✅ Check subscription tier after login
- ✅ Display current tier in settings

**NOT Allowed in App:**
- ❌ Any pricing displayed ($29, $79, etc.)
- ❌ "Buy", "Purchase", "Subscribe" buttons
- ❌ Payment forms
- ❌ Urgency messaging with pricing ("Only 47 spots at $29!")
- ❌ Price comparisons

### Pricing Tiers (As of Jan 2025)

**Free Tier:**
- Price: $0
- Features: Unlimited quotes (local only), 25 quotes/month, 5 PDF exports/month, 2 CSV exports/month
- No assemblies, no cloud sync

**Pro Tier - Founder Pricing:**
- Price: $29/mo or $290/yr (first 500 customers, locked forever)
- Regular price: $99/mo or $990/yr
- Features: Everything in Free + unlimited exports, custom assemblies, cloud sync, multi-device, company branding

**Premium Tier - Founder Pricing:**
- Price: $79/mo or $790/yr (first 100 customers, locked forever)
- Regular price: $199/mo or $1,990/yr
- Features: Everything in Pro + company logo on PDFs, Quote Wizard, advanced analytics, team collaboration (future), priority support

**Price Increase Triggers:**
- Primary: Hit customer cap (100 Pro = $49, 500 Pro = $99)
- Secondary: 90 days from TestFlight launch
- Backup: High conversion rate (>20%) for 30 days

### User Journey (Compliant)

1. User downloads free app from App Store
2. Uses app, sees "🔒 Pro Feature"
3. Taps "Learn More" → Opens quotecat.app in Safari
4. Website shows pricing, urgency, spots remaining
5. Buys via Stripe on website
6. Gets email with login credentials
7. Returns to app → Logs in
8. App checks Supabase: tier = 'pro'
9. Pro features unlock ✅

---

## 🗄️ Database Architecture (Supabase)

### Supabase Instance

- **Project:** QuoteCat Production
- **URL:** Configured in `.env` as `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- **Auth:** Anonymous key in `.env` as `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Region:** US-based
- **Access:** Supabase dashboard at supabase.com

### Tables (9 total)

**User & Subscription:**
1. `profiles` - User accounts, tier, company details, usage tracking, preferences
2. `subscriptions` - Payment history, tier management, billing info
3. `usage_events` - Analytics, feature usage tracking

**Quote Data:**
4. `quotes` - Cloud-synced quotes with RLS (Pro/Premium only)
5. `assemblies` - Custom assembly templates (Pro/Premium only)

**Product Catalog (Supplier API):**
6. `suppliers` - Lowe's, Home Depot, Menards, 1Build
7. `categories` - Product categories (Framing, Drywall, etc.) - **✅ Seeded with 7 categories**
8. `products` - Full product catalog with real-time pricing - **✅ Seeded with 368 AI products**
9. `product_prices` - Price history tracking

### Current Product Catalog Status (Nov 2024)

**Live in Supabase:**
- 368 AI-estimated products across 7 categories
- Categories: Framing, Fasteners, Drywall, Electrical, Plumbing, Roofing, Masonry
- All products marked as `data_source: 'ai_estimated'`
- App syncs from Supabase via pull-to-refresh
- Smart status indicator shows "Online (Up to date)" when synced

**Ready for Xbyte Data:**
- Migration 004 prepared (adds `retailer` field to products table) - **NOT run yet**
- Import script ready: `supabase/import_retailer_data.ts`
- Documentation: `supabase/IMPORT_GUIDE.md`, `supabase/RETAILER_DATA_SPEC.md`
- When Xbyte data arrives: Run migration 004 → Import data → Sync to app

### Security

All tables have Row-Level Security (RLS):
- Users can only see their own quotes/assemblies/profiles
- Product catalog is public read, service role only for writes
- Soft deletes via `deleted_at` (never lose data)

### Helper Functions

- `user_has_tier(required_tier)` - Check if user meets tier requirement
- `get_spots_remaining(tier, pricing)` - Count remaining founder slots
- `reset_monthly_usage()` - Reset PDF/CSV counters monthly

## 🔌 Supplier API Integration Plan

### Architecture

```
Supplier APIs (Lowe's, HD, Menards, 1Build) OR Xbyte (data provider)
    ↓
Supabase (products & categories tables) ← Central catalog
    ↓
App Cache (AsyncStorage) ← Fast, offline access
    ↓
User creates quotes with real-time pricing
```

### Data Flow

1. **Background Job (daily):** Supplier API OR Xbyte data → Supabase products table
2. **App startup:** Supabase products → AsyncStorage cache
3. **User creates quote:** Reads from AsyncStorage (fast, offline)
4. **Periodic sync (when online):** Check Supabase for price updates

### Target Suppliers

**Official APIs (Preferred):**
- **1Build** (Primary - aggregates multiple suppliers) - outreach sent
- **Lowe's** (Direct API) - exploring
- **Home Depot** (Direct API) - exploring
- **Menards** (Direct API) - emails sent to webedi@menards.com, sppurchasing@menards.com

**Interim Solution (Xbyte):**
- **Xbyte** (Data provider)
- Provides product & pricing data for construction materials
- Use case: Bootstrap with real data while pursuing official partnerships
- **Status (Nov 10, 2024):** ✅ Sample data received and reviewed, feedback email sent
  - Received sample from Home Depot, Lowe's, Menards (20 products each)
  - **Critical feedback:** Missing "Unit" field (EA, LF, SF, BOX, etc.) - MUST HAVE for quoting
  - Sample included non-construction items (toys) - need construction categories only
  - Requested updated sample: 100-200 products per retailer with Unit field
  - **Production scope clarified:** 2,000-5,000 products per retailer across construction categories
  - **Update frequency:** Daily preferred (overnight), weekly acceptable
  - **Delivery method:** API strongly preferred, webhook acceptable, file drop workable
  - **Next step:** Waiting for updated sample before discussing commercials

### Product Data Structure

- Real-time pricing and availability
- Product images and descriptions
- SKU, category, supplier info
- Retailer identifier (homedepot, lowes, menards)
- Data source tracking (ai_estimated, retailer_scraped, api_live, user_submitted)
- Stock quantities
- Last sync timestamp

**ALL TIERS** can access supplier catalog (free tier has quote limits, not catalog limits).

---

## 📱 Migration Strategy (Local → Cloud)

### Free Users
- All data stays in AsyncStorage (local only)
- Never touches Supabase
- Offline-first, no cloud sync

### Pro/Premium Users (First Login)

**Auto-migration on first sign-in:**

1. User logs in → Check if cloud has data
2. If cloud empty but local has data → Migrate
3. Show: "Importing your 15 quotes to cloud..."
4. Upload quotes, assemblies, company details to Supabase
5. Keep local data as cache
6. Success: "Your data is now backed up!"

**Ongoing sync:**
- Local AsyncStorage = Fast cache
- Supabase = Source of truth + backup
- Bi-directional sync (future)
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins

**Migration happens:**
- Automatically on first Pro/Premium login
- One-time, one-way (local → cloud)
- Non-destructive (keeps local copy)
- Progress indicator shown to user

## ⚠️ Critical Gotchas

### Apple In-App Purchase Compliance (CRITICAL)

**✅ Current Implementation (Compliant):**
- App has sign-in screen ONLY (no sign-up)
- NO pricing displayed anywhere in app
- NO payment buttons or upgrade flows
- NO "Buy Pro" or "Subscribe" language
- Sign-in screen shows: "Don't have an account? Visit quotecat.ai" → Opens Safari
- All account creation and payments happen on website (Stripe)

**User Flow (Apple-Compliant):**
1. **Free users:** Download app → Use immediately (no account needed, all local)
2. **Want Pro?** Tap locked feature → "This is a Pro feature" → "Learn More" → Opens quotecat.ai in Safari
3. **On website:** User creates account + pays via Stripe
4. **Back in app:** User signs in → Supabase checks tier → Pro unlocks
5. **Session persists:** User stays logged in between app launches

**What's Allowed:**
- ✅ "Sign In" button and screen
- ✅ Showing locked features with "🔒 Pro Feature" badge
- ✅ "Learn More" button that opens website in Safari
- ✅ Session persistence (auto-login)
- ✅ Tier checking (free/pro/premium)

**What's NOT Allowed:**
- ❌ Sign-up form in app
- ❌ Any pricing ($29, $79, etc.) displayed in app
- ❌ "Upgrade", "Buy Pro", "Subscribe" buttons in app
- ❌ Payment forms or Stripe checkout in app
- ❌ Urgency messaging with pricing in app

**Files Implementing This:**
- `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx` - Sign-in only, no sign-up
- `lib/auth.ts` - Supabase auth service
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Auto-login on launch
- `app/(main)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Drawer with sign-in button
- `app/(main)/settings.tsx` - Settings with sign-in option

### Supplier API Tables
- `products` and `categories` tables in Supabase are for supplier API data
- DO NOT delete these tables
- Currently seeded with 368 AI-estimated products
- Will be replaced/augmented by product data (Xbyte) or official APIs

### Data Migration
- Free users stay 100% local (no forced cloud)
- Pro/Premium users auto-migrate on first login
- Always keep local cache for offline access
- Supabase is backup + sync, not replacement

### Pricing Strategy
- Founder pricing ($29/$79) for first 100/500 customers
- Price locked forever for early adopters
- Raise prices at customer milestones, not time-based
- Grandfathering creates loyalty and urgency

### Product Data Strategy (Nov 2024)

**Context:** Need real product pricing quickly. Official APIs slow to respond. Working with Xbyte for product data.

**Approach:**
- Use Xbyte data to bootstrap with real product information
- Label data source appropriately in UI with disclaimers as needed

- Transition to official APIs when available

**Data Integration Plan:**
- Review sample data format and fields
- Test import pipeline with sample
- Evaluate data quality, coverage, and pricing accuracy
- Document data source and update dates for audit trail
- Add appropriate disclaimers in UI
- Monitor user feedback on data accuracy

**Philosophy:** Bootstrap quickly with available data sources while pursuing official partnerships. Transparency with users about data sources.
