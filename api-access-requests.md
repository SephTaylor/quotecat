**API Access Request:**

Hello Lowe's Developer Team,

I am writing to request API access for QuoteCat, a mobile estimating application designed specifically for residential and commercial contractors.

**About QuoteCat:**

QuoteCat helps contractors create accurate, professional material estimates and quotes for their construction projects. Our users are professional electricians, general contractors, framers, and other trades who regularly purchase materials from Lowe's locations nationwide.

**Proposed API Use Case:**

We would like to integrate live pricing data from Lowe's to help our contractor users:

1. **Create accurate estimates** - Pull current pricing for common construction materials (lumber, electrical, plumbing, hardware)
2. **Drive in-store purchases** - Quotes include Lowe's as the recommended supplier, directing contractors to your stores
3. **Save contractors time** - Eliminate manual price lookups, allowing them to focus on their projects

**Technical Requirements:**

- **API Endpoints Needed:** Product pricing, availability (if available), basic product info
- **Estimated Volume:** ~1,000-2,000 API requests per month initially
- **Update Frequency:** Daily or weekly price updates for ~50-100 products
- **Data Usage:** Pricing data used exclusively within our app for quote generation (not publicly displayed or resold)

**Benefits to Lowe's:**

- **Increased Sales:** Contractors receive estimates with current Lowe's pricing, driving them to purchase from your stores
- **Brand Visibility:** QuoteCat users associate Lowe's with professional-grade materials and accurate pricing
- **Market Research:** We can provide anonymized insights on which products contractors quote most frequently

**Compliance Commitments:**

- We will include proper attribution ("Pricing from Lowe's") in all quotes
- Pricing data will be refreshed regularly (not cached indefinitely)
- We will comply with all API terms of service and rate limits
- We will not resell or publicly display your pricing data

**Business Information:**

- Registered Business Entity: [LLC/Corporation Name]
- Tax ID: [EIN if applicable]
- Business Location: [Your State/City]
- Target Market: Professional contractors across the United States

We believe this partnership would be mutually beneficial, helping contractors work more efficiently while increasing Lowe's visibility and sales within the professional trades community.

I'm happy to provide additional information, sign commercial agreements, or discuss this opportunity further at your convenience.

Thank you for considering our request.
